      With the memory of their struggle buried deep in their hearts... In this
      hard-core action RPG, Jack must hazard numerous challenges to bring the
      light of the crystals back to Cornelia, a kingdom conquered by darkness.
      Will restoring the crystals' light usher in peace or a new form of
      darkness? ...Or perhaps something else entirely?
