      Resident Evil 6 remains a blank space in my knowledge of the core series
      and for good reason.


      It is essentially when the series "jumped shark" - 4 campaigns,
      cover-based shooting, and nearly zero horror elements - it is the reason
      Resident Evil 7 had to be a "reboot".

The technically eighth entry in the popular horror series features the return of leading protagonists Leon S. Kennedy and Chris Redfield, along with new character Jake Muller, to combat against the latest B.O.W. manufacturer Neo-Umbrella.
