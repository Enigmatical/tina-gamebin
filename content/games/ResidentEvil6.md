      Resident Evil 6 is a Survival-Horror game that continues the struggle
      against the series' signature zombie inducing bio-terror, while raising
      the bar with all new game functionality. Players enjoy a diverse play
      experience, highlighted by the ability to select between three scenarios
      featuring multiple characters and intertwined storylines. Within these
      scenarios both stories and action cross paths. Additional features include
      zombies as well as new enemies, upgradable firepower and characters,
      vehicle based options, the mini-game based Mercenaries mode, and
      single-player and co-op play options.

      Resident Evil 6 remains a blank space in my knowledge of the core series
      and for good reason.


      It is essentially when the series "jumped shark" - 4 campaigns,
      cover-based shooting, and nearly zero horror elements - it is the reason
      Resident Evil 7 had to be a "reboot".
