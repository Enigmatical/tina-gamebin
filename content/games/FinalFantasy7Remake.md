      What begins as a rebellion against an evil corporation becomes much more,
      and what erupts goes beyond imagination. The story of this first,
      standalone game in the Final Fantasy VII Remake project covers up to the
      party's escape from Midgar and goes deeper into the events occurring in
      the city than the original Final Fantasy VII.

      I have such a history with Final Fantasy 7 that I'm actually not sure I
      can write this review. Final Fantasy 7 (and Resident Evil 2) were probably
      the first two "big" games I ever played... ever. In over two decades of
      playing video games almost daily, Final Fantasy 7 was the first - nothing
      can compare to that.


      So when the idea of a Remake was being tossed around, I had to keep my
      feelings in check. This wasn't going to be that strange JRPG that I tore
      through on Summer break back in high school. This was going to be
      something else.


      And boy... am I so damn glad they created something else. Having the
      original Final Fantasy 7 in my mind only made me enjoy this experience all
      the more.
