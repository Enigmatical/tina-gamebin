      I have such a history with Final Fantasy 7 that I'm actually not sure I
      can write this review. Final Fantasy 7 (and Resident Evil 2) were probably
      the first two "big" games I ever played... ever. In over two decades of
      playing video games almost daily, Final Fantasy 7 was the first - nothing
      can compare to that.


      So when the idea of a Remake was being tossed around, I had to keep my
      feelings in check. This wasn't going to be that strange JRPG that I tore
      through on Summer break back in high school. This was going to be
      something else.


      And boy... am I so damn glad they created something else. Having the
      original Final Fantasy 7 in my mind only made me enjoy this experience all
      the more.
