      Dark Cloud 2, also known as Dark Chronicle, was developed by Level-5 and
      published by Sony. Just like its predecessor Dark Cloud, the game is a
      randomly-generated dungeon crawler with town building and weapon synthesis
      mechanics. New to the series is time-travel. The majority of the game is
      set in the past, where the player will have to meet certain conditions in
      order to restore the future to what it once was.

      I originally bought this game in 2003 when it was released for the PS2
      after amazingly high critical reviews. At the time, I'd played -some- of
      Dark Cloud 1, but this game was supposed to be such an improvement on that
      formula that I couldn't help it.


      I don't even know what sort of money I had in 2003...


      Anyway, having finished Dark Cloud 1 at the end of December (and
      thoroughly hating it), I knew that Dark Cloud 2 would be better. And it is
      - but it still has a lot of the same problems. Dark Cloud 2 is a better
      game because the repetitive nature of dungeon crawling is covered by so
      many other activities - 4 essentially different characters (though I never
      touched Monster Transformation), fishing, golfing (ahem, Spheda),
      world-building, medal chasing, weapon building...


      This is a game that heralds having a "100+ Hour Adventure" as a bullet
      point on the back.


      I enjoyed my time with it; it's a very good game. When I was... 16-17,
      this would've been my dream game.
