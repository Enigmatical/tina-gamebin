      Gravity Rush is a single player Action-Adventure game with RPG and
      Platforming game elements that is specifically designed for PlayStation
      Vita. Utilizing PS Vita specific functionality such as the gyro motion
      sensor of the PS Vita, highly refined graphics and touch control
      capabilities, and a rich storyline rendered in a crisp
      comic/animation-like style, Gravity Rush provides an engrossing 3D
      experience in which the usual laws of gravity cease to exist. Additional
      features include: simple shoulder button-based controls for
      gravity-altering move, varied enemy and boss battles, and beat-em-up
      combat.
