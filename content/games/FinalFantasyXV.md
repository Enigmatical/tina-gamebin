      The only crystal left to the world lies in the Kingdom of Lucis. Upon
      striking a peace with the garrison state of Niflheim, Lucis rejoices in
      having at last brought the cold war to a close. Their celebrations,
      however, are premature. Under the guise of amity, Niflheim dispels the
      anti-armament runewall and launches a full-scale invasion of the kingdom.
      The peaceful lives Crown Prince Noctis and his entourage once knew are
      consumed by the flames of war as they struggle to mount a resistance.
