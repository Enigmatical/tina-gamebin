      Then, there was fire. Re-experience the critically acclaimed,
      genre-defining game that started it all. Beautifully remastered, return to
      Lordran in stunning high-definition detail running at 60fps.


      Live Through A Million Deaths & Earn Your Legacy. Enter a dark world
      filled with despair and threaded by hope where your ability to creatively
      strategize, learn and overcome unpredictable and unique challenges
      determines your fate. Dark Souls will demand your absolute concentration,
      unflinchingly punish your mistakes, but reward your ability to learn from
      death. Each challenge is a mind game met with endless combinations that
      will test your ability to creatively strategize a way to conquer
      unimaginable monsters and progress deeper into this bleak and forbidding
      environment filled with the un-dead.

A quasi-sequel to From Software's action-RPG Demon's Souls, set in a new universe while retaining most of the basic gameplay and the high level of challenge. It features a less-linear world, a new checkpoint system in the form of bonfires, and the unique Humanity system.
