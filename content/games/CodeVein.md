      In the not too distant future, a mysterious disaster has brought collapse
      to the world as we know it. Towering skyscrapers, once symbols of
      prosperity, are now lifeless graves of humanityâ€™s past pierced by the
      Thorns of Judgment. At the center of the destruction lies a hidden society
      of Revenants called Vein. This final stronghold is where the remaining few
      fight to survive, blessed with Gifts of power in exchange for their
      memories and a thirst for blood. Give into the bloodlust fully and risk
      becoming one of the Lost, fiendish ghouls devoid of any remaining
      humanity. Wandering aimlessly in search of blood, the Lost will stop at
      nothing to satisfy their hunger. Team up and embark on a journey to the
      ends of hell to unlock your past and escape your living nightmare in CODE
      VEIN.

      As a big fan of the "Soulsborne" series, the idea of an "Anime" Dark Souls
      was definitely interesting.


      While not a direct copy, this game has enough interesting ideas to keep me
      interested.
