      Blurring the lines between cautious strategy and unbridled mayhem,
      SUPERHOT is the FPS in which time moves only when you move. No
      regenerating health bars. No conveniently placed ammo drops. It's just
      you, outnumbered and outgunned, grabbing the weapons of fallen enemies to
      shoot, slice, and maneuver through a hurricane of slow-motion bullets.

A puzzling first-person shooter in which time only progresses when the player moves.
