      Paradise Island, a world outside reality. There’s been a murder that only
      "investigation freak" Lady Love Dies can solve. Gather evidence and
      interrogate suspects in this open world adventure. You can accuse anyone,
      but you’ll have to prove your case in trial to convict. It’s up to you to
      decide who’s guilty.

      This title sits in the same pantheon as other games like "The Outer Wilds"
      and "The Forgotten City" and came on my radar after I finished those two
      and wanted more open-world mysteries.
