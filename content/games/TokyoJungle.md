      Humans disappeared from Tokyo all of a sudden, leaving the animals to fend
      for themselves. Play the game as various animals in this apocalyptic
      scene. Learn to hunt, gather, and mark territory.


      But survival isn't quite so simple. There might be poison in certain food,
      and your player animal might be infected by other animals. Watch out for
      their health as you create your home out of the rubble. The climate and
      the temperature affects your animals as well. Beware of the rotten food in
      the summer and the rains damaging your den.


      There are many ways to survive, but only a few can. Become one of them in
      Tokyo Jungle.
