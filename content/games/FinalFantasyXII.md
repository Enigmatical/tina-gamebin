      Two years after the fall of Dalmasca, the citizens are without guidance
      and direction. In the capital city of Rabanastre, the denizens gather and
      await the introduction of Archadia's new consul. To Vaan, a young man
      living on the streets of Rabanastre, the Empire is a hated enemy who took
      the life of his brother, the only family he had left. In an effort to
      exact revenge, Vaan hatches a plot to break into the palace and steal from
      the occupying imperials. There, he gets more than he bargained for as he
      runs into Princess Ashe, the sole surviving heir to the Dalmascan throne.
      Together, the two will embark on an incredible journey through Ivalice,
      tracing the mysteries behind the Archadian Empire's invasion. The choices
      they make will determine the very fate of the world.

      Hot on the heels of getting the Platinum in Final Fantasy 7 Remake, I did
      not want to let go of my enjoyment of Final Fantasy.


      Final Fantasy 12 has always been one of my favorites (if not, my all-time
      favorite). While the story reeks of boring "political intrigue," the
      combat system (and particularly the Gambit System) is something else. To a
      software developer, it is pure heaven.


      The "Zodiac Age" adds in the Job System, infinite respecs, and a
      staggering amount of additional content. I finished this game last year
      with my good friend, but I decided for this playthrough I would also chase
      the Platinum.


      I've already got my sights set on Final Fantasy X, a game I played through
      once back when it first came out.
