      Hot on the heels of getting the Platinum in Final Fantasy 7 Remake, I did
      not want to let go of my enjoyment of Final Fantasy.


      Final Fantasy 12 has always been one of my favorites (if not, my all-time
      favorite). While the story reeks of boring "political intrigue," the
      combat system (and particularly the Gambit System) is something else. To a
      software developer, it is pure heaven.


      The "Zodiac Age" adds in the Job System, infinite respecs, and a
      staggering amount of additional content. I finished this game last year
      with my good friend, but I decided for this playthrough I would also chase
      the Platinum.


      I've already got my sights set on Final Fantasy X, a game I played through
      once back when it first came out.
