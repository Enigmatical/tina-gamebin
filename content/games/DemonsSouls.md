      Entirely rebuilt from the ground up, this remake invites you to experience
      the unsettling story and ruthless combat of Demonâ€™s Souls.

      like never before, presenting seamless interconnectivity that serves in
      every instance to enhance the single-player game. Unprecedented in its
      depth and subtlety, peerless in its relentlessly challenging gameplay,
      Demon's Souls is the ultimate action RPG.
